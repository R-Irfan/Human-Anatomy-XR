# Human-Anatomy-XR

This prototype makes human anatomy learning accessible, engaging, and immersive by allowing users to interact with life-sized 3D models, with scientifically accurate terminology and explore Anatomy structure parts up close for a hands-on learning experience.
2. Core Features and Mechanics:
Visualize & explore scientifically accurate anatomy models.
Grab and inspect parts closely to learn structures.
Place the parts at their original position for structural awareness.
Visual & Audio feedback while interacting with Anatomy.
3. Tools Used and What I Learned:
Tools: Unity 6, Meta-OpenXR, XR Interaction Toolkit, XR Hands.
Learned the importance of Visual and Audio feedback for hand tracking interactions.
Designed and implemented a simple Visual and Audio Feedback Affordance system.
4. Why XR is Better:
Immersive, engaging experience vs static textbooks.
Learn anywhere, no lab required.
Reinforces understanding with interactive, life-sized models.
